# Transactions

Transacting in the digital realm is equivalent to casting spells; each with its own purpose, power, and allure. With Lunary Wallet, these spells come in the form of token transfers ‚Äì be it the might of SOL or the diversified power of SPL tokens. Let's unravel these enchanted scrolls together.

## Sending SOL or SPL Tokens

With great power comes great responsibility ‚Äì and also, great ease. Sending SOL or SPL tokens with Lunary Wallet is as seamless as whispering into the winds of the blockchain.

### The Magic Spell: `/send`

- **Command the Winds**: Typing /send conjures a dialog straight from the digital ether. Specify the recipient, the amount, and the token type. It‚Äôs like sending a paper airplane, but instead of paper, it‚Äôs your assets, and instead of air, it's blockchain.

- **Approval and Dispatch**: Once you‚Äôve confirmed the details with the precision of an archer, hit send, and watch as your tokens embark on their journey. Picture it as releasing a carrier pigeon into the dawn, carrying your message across the continents.

### The Wonders Await

- **For SPL Tokens**: Fancy sending something other than SOL? Fear not, for the diversity of your assets makes your financial tapestry richer. Just ensure you‚Äôve got the right symbol, and let `/send` be your guide.

- **Mark your transactions**: Want to add a note to your transaction? Simply provide a memo when prompted. It‚Äôs like leaving a message in a bottle, only this one is guaranteed to reach its destination.

- **Tracking the Voyage**: After dispatch, you can nearly hear the flutter of wings as your tokens find their way. Await confirmation, and bam! Transaction completed ‚Äì as satisfying as planting your flag on an uncharted island.

### Right-Click, Send SOL: The Context Menu Magic

For those moments when even typing feels like a chore, or you want to add a dash of stealth to your generosity, the context menu is your cloak of invisibility.

- **A Sleight of Hand**: Navigate to the user profile, right-click (or tap, for the mages using enchanted tablets), tap on Apps and select ‚ÄúSend SOL‚Äù. It‚Äôs like locking eyes with your ally across the room and nodding; no words needed, the pact is sealed.

### A Deep Dive into the `/send` Command

Let‚Äôs break down this spell for those curious about the alchemy behind it:

- **Versatility** : Whether sending tokens to a friend as a gift, paying for services in the magical realm of the internet, or simply moving assets, the `/send` command is your universal tool.
- **Precision**: Specify the exact amount, down to the smallest fraction. In a world of digital abundance, every lamport counts.

Transactions in Lunary Wallet are more than mere exchanges; they‚Äôre the threads that weave the tapestry of our digital existence. With every send, you‚Äôre not just moving assets, you‚Äôre casting ripples across the blockchain, echoing through the ages.

And that, my intrepid companion, is the essence of Transactions with Lunary Wallet. As we progress, remember: Every action you take is part of a larger journey within the Solana cosmos. üåå
