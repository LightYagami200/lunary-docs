# Safety and Security

In the world of digital assets, where pirates lurk in the shadows and tricksters weave spells of deception, Lunary Wallet stands as a bastion of protection. Let‚Äôs uncover the layers of magic and might that keep your treasures safe.

## Encryptions: The Arcane Shield

In Lunary Wallet, your seed phrases and private keys are sealed behind walls etched with ancient runes ‚Äì encryptions so powerful, not even the wittiest of wizards could breach them without the key.

### The Vault of Secrets

- **Layers upon Layers**: Imagine your digital assets locked in a vault, within a fortress, on an island, surrounded by a sea of fire. That's the level of encryption we're talking about. No brute force of man or machine can break through without your unique key ‚Äì the password you set.

- **A Shared Secret**: When you create that encryption key, it‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre making a pact with the guardians of the digital realm. You alone hold the power to unlock the gates, to glimpse the treasures within.

## The "What Ifs": Tales of Lost Keys

The realm of digital assets is not without its tales of woe. Forgotten passwords and lost keys are akin to ships disappearing into the mists, never to be seen again.

### The Immutable Law

- **The Lost Password Conundrum**: In Lunary Wallet, losing your password is like losing the map to your treasure. The encryption is so strong, without your password, not even the creators of Lunary can summon your assets back from the digital aether.
- **A Word of Wisdom**: Guard your password as you would your most precious treasure. Write it in the pages of your spellbook, carve it into the stones of your castle, but never let it be forgotten or fall into the wrong hands.

## The Ever-Vigilant Watch

While Lunary offers formidable defenses, the quest for security is an ever-evolving journey.

Allies in Arms
